## Predict Changes In Air Quality Based On Industry

### Abstract

With this project we plan to look at data on air quality by county and the growth of certain industries over time to determine if there is a correlation between certain industries growth and changes in air quality by county. Air Quality can be tied to many socioeconomic factors, and we felt it was important to track the AQI to determine what industries have a sizeable impact on those factors. 

### Questions we hope to answer:

What industries, if any, have a noticeable impact on Air Quality?

What have the general trends over 10 years been within certain industries?

What have the general trends over 10 years been in Air Quality?

### Machine Learning Module: 
 
Taking Median AQI by Year and Industry Employment by County. 
 
Linear Regression Model testing significance of Industry on Air Quality Index 

We plan to test a few other models as well, but the goal is to find a model that can consistently predict air quality changes based on inudstry growth.
